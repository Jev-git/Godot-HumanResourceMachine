# Doing
* All draggable instruction nodes should behave the same:
    * If dropped outside of the solution area, they will disappear
    * ~~If hovered over the solution area, create a placeholder~~
* The instruction sources should stay still: can just be a sprite, spawn an actually instruction node upon start dragging.
# Time range
Sept 20th - Oct 4th (2.5 weeks)

* Loop instructions that have a head and a tail
* Verify the solution by trying it out with a bunch of different inputs
